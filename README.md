Follow these steps to install and run the Medics software on your local machine.

### 5.1 Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/medics.git
5.2 Install Dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
cd medics
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can manually install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas openpyxl
5.3 Database Setup
Ensure that you have the necessary Excel files (patients.xlsx and doctors.xlsx) in the root directory. If not, create them manually or run the following script to generate template files:

bash
Copy code
python setup_database.py
6. Usage
6.1 Running the Application
Once you have installed all dependencies, run the following command to start the application:

bash
Copy code
python medics.py
6.2 Patient Login
Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to enter their username and password.
Once authenticated, patients can access their medical dashboard.
6.3 Doctor Login
Doctors use a separate login page to access their dashboard, where they can manage patients and appointments.
6.4 Diagnosis Submission
Patients can input their symptoms or diagnoses in the input fields.
After submission, the system will retrieve related medical information from the database.
6.5 Appointment Scheduling
Patients can view available doctors and schedule appointments directly from their dashboard.
Appointments are stored in the Excel database for both patients and doctors.
7. Excel Database Structure
The Excel files are critical to how Medics stores and manages data. Below is the structure for both files:

7.1 Patient Sheet
Column Name	Data Type	Description
Patient Name	String	The full name of the patient.
Username	String	The patient's username for login.
Password	String	The patient's password (encrypted).
Diagnosis	String	The diagnosis or symptoms entered by the patient.
Appointment Date	DateTime	The date and time of the scheduled appointment.
Doctor Assigned	String	The doctor assigned to the patient.
7.2 Doctor Sheet
Column Name	Data Type	Description
Doctor Name	String	The full name of the doctor.
Username	String	The doctor's username for login.
Password	String	The doctor's password (encrypted).
Assigned Patients	List	A list of patients assigned to the doctor.
8. Code Breakdown
Here is an overview of the important code components in the Medics system.

8.1 Patient Class
python
Copy code
class Patient:
    def __init__(self, username, password):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        # Fetch patient details from Excel file.
        self.patient_data = self.load_patient_data()

    def load_patient_data(self):
        # Logic to load patient data from patients.xlsx
        pass

    def submit_diagnosis(self, diagnosis):
        # Logic to update diagnosis in the Excel file.
        pass

    def schedule_appointment(self, doctor, date):
        # Logic to schedule an appointment in the Excel file.
        pass
8.2 Doctor Class
python
Copy code
class Doctor:
    def __init__(self, username, password):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        # Fetch doctor details from Excel file.
        self.doctor_data = self.load_doctor_data()

    def load_doctor_data(self):
        # Logic to load doctor data from doctors.xlsx
        pass

    def view_patients(self):
        # Logic to view all assigned patients.
        pass
8.3 Appointment Management
python
Copy code
def assign_patient_to_doctor(patient, doctor):
    # Logic to assign a patient to a specific doctor in the Excel sheet.
    pass
9. Error Handling and Debugging
To ensure smooth operation, the following error handling mechanisms are implemented:

Invalid Login: If a patient or doctor enters incorrect login credentials, the system will prompt an error message.
Empty Diagnosis: The system will not allow a patient to submit an empty diagnosis field.
Excel File Access: If the Excel files are inaccessible or corrupted, the system will prompt the user to restore the files.
10. Development Guidelines
Follow Python best practices for writing clean, maintainable code. Avoid hardcoding paths or credentials.

11. Unit Testing
Use pytest or another testing framework to write unit tests for the critical functionality, such as login validation, diagnosis submission, and appointment scheduling.

12. Continuous Integration (CI)
Integrate this repository with GitHub Actions or any other CI/CD tool to automate testing upon new commits.

13. Known Issues
Excel File Corruption: In rare cases, Excel files may become corrupted due to improper shutdowns.
